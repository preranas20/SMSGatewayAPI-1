# SMSGatewayApp

Abstract:
SMS Gateway app. This app focuses on developing a mobile SMS gateway using an Android app which is deployed to enable the sending and receiving of SMS. The mobile app is to be deployed on an Android phone and it should notify a server when a SMS is received and indicate the sender, receiver, and message content. The server app should enable the addition of new devices (phones), show a log of the received messages, and allow the registration of callback urls that are called when messages are received from a specific android gateway app. This app is similar to Twilio but using android app and a server instead of Twilio. In addition, the server should be able to communicate with the android app and request it sends a messages to a specific receiver.

# Description of the app and functionalities:

To create a sms gateway using two components a gateway server and a gateway app. For the developer who wants utilize this gateway.
Gateway will generate an API key for all the users to authorize the users and provide them a way to communicate with their registered phone numbers through a gateway server. Where the mapping of the developer, its devices and the webhooks to talk with are stored.
Once the developer initiates a communication with gateway server using the message sending api the message is relayed to particular device of the developer. This device has our gateway app which gets a push notification from gateway server and then in turn sends the sms to the respective phone number requested by the developer in the sending api.
Whereas when one of these phone numbers receive the sms they talk through the gateway app to our gateway server which figures out which developer is registered with this device/phone number and uses its respective webhook to call the call back api. And the message is relayed to the developer.

For current considerations the developer server app is not in scope.
